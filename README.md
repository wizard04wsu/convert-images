# Convert Images
Drag &amp; drop images onto [this web page](https://wizard04wsu.github.io/convert-images/converter.htm) to convert them to another format, resized and with a chosen background color.

This uses a `<canvas>` element to redraw the image files, optionally with size and background color changes, then generates `<img>` elements in the chosen format. The background color can be any value accepted for the CSS `background-color` property.

The image type drop-down only includes formats that the browser can convert a `<canvas>` element into (namely, PNG, JPEG, and WebP).
