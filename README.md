# Convert Images
Drag &amp; drop images onto this web page to convert them to another format, resized and with a chosen background color.

This uses a `canvas` element to redraw the image files, optionally with size and background color changes, then generates `img` elements in the chosen format.

The only target formats supported are PNG and JPEG, since those seem to be the only ones that most browsers support. (Unsupported formats would just get saved as PNG anyway.)
